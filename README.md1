# ☁️ AWS Cloud Practitioner: Amazon S3 Summary

Congratulations on completing the S3 section of your AWS course! 🎉  
This document is a comprehensive summary of the **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** to help reinforce your understanding and prepare you for the exam.

---

## 📦 What is S3?
- **Object-based storage** for files in the cloud.
- Not suitable for operating systems or databases.
- Store files ranging from **0 bytes to 5 TB**.
- **Unlimited** total volume and number of objects.
- Data is stored in **buckets** with globally **unique names** (universal namespace).
- Bucket URLs follow the pattern:  
  `https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<key>`

---

## ✅ S3 Basics
- Uploading files returns an **HTTP 200** status.
- **Key** = Object name (e.g., `image.jpg`)
- **Value** = File data
- **Version ID** = Identifier for object versions
- **Metadata** = Data about your data (e.g., last modified)

---

## 🔒 S3 Security

### Default Security
- Buckets & objects are **private by default**.
- Public access must be explicitly enabled.

### Access Control
- **Object ACLs**: Manage permissions at object level.
- **Bucket Policies**: Manage permissions at bucket level.

---

## 🌐 Static Website Hosting
- S3 supports **static websites** only.
- Use **bucket policies** to make content public.
- S3 automatically scales—no need for load balancers.

---

## 🌀 Versioning
- Allows storing **multiple versions** of an object.
- **Cannot be disabled**, only suspended.
- Deleted objects are marked with a **delete marker**.
- Supports integration with **lifecycle rules** and **MFA delete**.

---

## 🗃️ Storage Classes

| Class                          | Use Case                                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **S3 Standard**               | General-purpose, frequently accessed data     |
| **S3 Standard-IA**           | Infrequently accessed, critical data          |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**           | Infrequently accessed, non-critical data      |
| **Glacier**                  | Archival, retrieval within minutes to hours   |
| **Glacier Deep Archive**     | Archival, retrieval >12 hours, lowest cost    |
| **Intelligent-Tiering**      | Automated tiering for unpredictable access    |

---

## 🔁 Lifecycle Management
- Automates transitions between storage classes.
- Works with **versioning**.
- Applies to current and previous versions.

---

## 🔐 Object Lock (WORM Model)
- **Write Once, Read Many** (WORM) protection.
- Two modes:
  - **Governance**: Only users with special permissions can overwrite.
  - **Compliance**: No one can overwrite/delete, not even root.
- For Glacier, use **Glacier Vault Lock** for similar functionality.

---

## 🔐 Encryption

### Encryption In Transit
- Uses **SSL / HTTPS** for secure uploads.

### Encryption At Rest
- **SSE-S3**: AES-256, managed by Amazon
- **SSE-KMS**: Managed with AWS KMS
- **SSE-C**: Customer-provided keys
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Encrypt files before upload
- Bucket policies can **enforce encryption** via headers (`x-amz-server-side-encryption`)

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### Prefixes
- A **prefix** = folder/subfolder in a bucket.
- Requests per second (per prefix):
  - 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE
  - 5,500 GET/HEAD
- More prefixes = better performance.

### Multipart Upload
- Use for uploads >100 MB (required for >5 GB)
- Improves performance by uploading in parts.

### Byte-Range Fetches
- Speeds up downloads by breaking large files into parallel parts.

---

## 🔁 S3 Replication

- Copy objects from one bucket to another (same or cross-region).
- **Not retroactive**: existing objects are not replicated by default.
- **Delete markers** are not replicated unless configured.

---

## 🧠 Key Exam Tips
- Understand **storage classes** and their use cases.
- Know the difference between **bucket policies** and **object ACLs**.
- Remember how **versioning** and **encryption** work.
- Be aware of **performance limits**, **prefix usage**, and **replication behavior**.

# AWS Route 53 - Section Review

## Overview
In this section, we covered AWS Route 53, focusing on its DNS management capabilities, routing policies, domain registration, health checks, and more. Below is a detailed review of the key concepts you should remember for the exam.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Alias Record vs CNAME**
   - **Alias Record**: Unique to AWS, used for translating domain names to AWS resources (e.g., Elastic Load Balancer, S3 bucket).
     - Can be used for both **naked domain names** and **subdomains**.
   - **CNAME**: Used for translating **subdomains** from one to another (e.g., `M.Acloudguru.com` to `mobile.Acloudguru.com`).
   - **Exam Tip**: Always choose an alias record over a CNAME in exam scenarios.

### 2. **Common DNS Record Types**
   - **Start of Authority (SOA)**, **CNAME**, **NS (Name Server)**, **A Record** (maps domain names to IP addresses).

### 3. **Route 53 Routing Policies (6 to remember)**
   - **Simple Routing**: One record, multiple IPs. Route 53 picks an IP at random.
   - **Weighted Routing**: Distribute traffic based on weights (percentages) to different regions or availability zones.
   - **Latency-Based Routing**: Direct users to the region with the lowest latency.
   - **Failover Routing**: Automatically switch traffic from a primary site (active) to a secondary site (passive) upon failure.
   - **Geolocation Routing**: Route traffic based on user location (e.g., European users go to European servers).
   - **Geoproximity Routing**: Route traffic based on the geographic location of resources and users, with an optional bias to favor certain regions.
   
### 4. **Multi-Value Answer Routing**
   - Return multiple values (IP addresses) for a query. Automatically redirect traffic to healthy instances based on health checks.

### 5. **Domain Registration**
   - AWS allows direct domain name registration through Route 53. It can take up to 3 days for the registration process to complete, depending on the domain.

### 6. **Health Checks**
   - Configure health checks on individual records. If a record fails, Route 53 removes it until it passes the health check again.
   - SNS notifications can alert you about health check failures.

## Exam Tips
- For routing policies, focus on the following:
  - **Weighted Routing**: For specific traffic distribution (e.g., 80% traffic to one region, 20% to another).
  - **Latency Routing**: For reducing latency by choosing the region with the best response time.
  - **Failover Routing**: For automatic failover from active to passive sites in case of failure.
  - **Geolocation Routing**: When traffic needs to be directed to specific locations based on the user’s region.
  - **Geoproximity Routing**: When more granular control over traffic routing is needed based on user and resource location.
  - **Multi-Value Answer Routing**: To ensure traffic is directed to only healthy resources.

## Summary
You’ve completed a thorough review of AWS Route 53. Remember these routing policies and DNS record types, and focus on health checks, domain registration, and making the right choices in scenario-based exam questions.

If you're ready to dive into the next section, proceed! If you need to review any of the material above, feel free to revisit it. 

Good luck with your AWS certification journey!


# AWS Elastic Load Balancing - Section Review

## Overview
Congratulations! You've reached the end of the Elastic Load Balancing section. In this review, we'll summarize the key concepts you need to know for the exam, including the different types of load balancers, health checks, listeners, sticky sessions, and more.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Types of Load Balancers**
   - **Application Load Balancers (ALB)**: Operate at **Layer 7** (Application Layer) and provide intelligent routing based on request content.
     - Use cases: HTTP/HTTPS traffic, URL-based routing, host-based routing.
     - **Limitation**: Only supports HTTP/HTTPS. Requires SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS listeners.
   
   - **Network Load Balancers (NLB)**: Operate at **Layer 4** (Transport Layer) and are designed for extreme performance.
     - Use cases: High-performance needs, non-HTTP/HTTPS protocols, TCP/UDP traffic.
     - Can also decrypt traffic (requires installing SSL/TLS certificates).

   - **Gateway Load Balancers**: Operate at **Layer 3** (Network Layer) and are used for inline virtual appliances.
     - Use cases: Deep packet inspection, traffic inspection, and network security.

   - **Classic Load Balancers**: Operate at both **Layer 4** and **Layer 7**. Typically used for test and dev environments.
     - Use cases: Basic load balancing needs, legacy support.

### 2. **Health Checks**
   - Health checks ensure traffic is routed to healthy instances or targets.
   - If an instance fails a health check, it is removed from routing until it passes again.

### 3. **Listeners and Rules (for ALB)**
   - **Listener**: Monitors connection requests on a specific port (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).
   - **Rules**: Define how traffic is routed to targets based on conditions (such as URL path, host header, etc.). Each rule has a priority, actions, and conditions.

### 4. **Target Groups (for ALB)**
   - A target group routes traffic to one or more registered targets (e.g., EC2 instances).
   - Specify the protocol and port number for each target group.

### 5. **Sticky Sessions**
   - Sticky sessions enable users to be directed to the same EC2 instance for the duration of their session.
   - Useful when application data is stored locally on the instance.
   - For **ALB**, sticky sessions are configured at the target group level, not on individual EC2 instances.

### 6. **Deregistration Delay / Connection Draining**
   - **Deregistration Delay (or Connection Draining)** keeps existing connections open when an EC2 instance is deregistered or becomes unhealthy.
   - If you want to immediately close connections, disable deregistration delay.

### 7. **Common Errors**
   - **504 Gateway Timeout**: This error occurs when the application is not responding within the idle timeout period. Troubleshoot the application server or database server.

### 8. **X-Forwarded-For Header**
   - If you need the **IP address** of the end user, look for the **X-Forwarded-For** header.

## Exam Tips
- **Application Load Balancer**: Focus on HTTP/HTTPS, SSL/TLS, listeners, rules, and target groups.
- **Network Load Balancer**: Focus on extreme performance, Layer 4, and support for non-HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
- **Gateway Load Balancer**: Keep in mind Layer 3 and inline virtual appliance use cases.
- **Classic Load Balancer**: Generally used for legacy systems.
- **Sticky Sessions**: Remember that sticky sessions can be enabled at the target group level for **ALB**. 

## Summary
You’ve now completed the Elastic Load Balancing section of this course! Keep these key points in mind as you head into your exam. Good luck, and if you're ready for the next section, let's dive in!

# High Availability and Scaling - Exam Tips

## Overview
Welcome back, Cloud Gurus! In this lesson, we are reviewing essential exam tips focused on **high availability** and **scaling**. These tips will help you understand key concepts, including scaling strategies, cost-effectiveness, and high availability practices that are crucial to answering exam questions effectively.

## Exam Tips

### 1. **Key Questions to Ask Yourself**
   - **Is it highly available?**
     - Always prioritize solutions that ensure high availability, even if the question doesn't explicitly mention it. Only deviate from this if the situation explicitly focuses on cost over availability.
   
   - **Should this be horizontally or vertically scaled?**
     - **Horizontal scaling** (adding more instances/resources) is usually the preferred option for scalability and availability. It is ideal for most workloads.
     - **Vertical scaling** (resizing an instance) may be needed for specific cases, such as increasing network throughput for a small instance like a t2.micro.

   - **Is the scaling solution cost-effective?**
     - Keep cost in mind even if the question doesn't ask for a cost-effective solution. Always consider cheaper options that still meet the requirements.
   
   - **Could we switch the database to fix our problem?**
     - On the exam, switching databases (e.g., from a relational database to DynamoDB) can be a solution, even though it would be complex in real life. This can be the right answer in AWS-specific scenarios.

### 2. **Auto Scaling Tips**
   - **Auto scaling is only for EC2 instances**.
     - **EC2** is the only resource that can be added to auto scaling groups. You cannot add services like RDS, Lambda, or load balancers into these groups, even though some of them can scale independently.
   
   - **Get ahead of the workload**.
     - For predictable, consistent workloads (e.g., at 5:00 PM every day), spin up instances ahead of time (e.g., at 4:45 PM) to avoid catching up with demand.
   
   - **Shorten provisioning time**.
     - **Bake your AMIs** with dependencies and code to reduce provisioning time, making instances come online faster and avoiding delays in responding to new workloads.

   - **Spread across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)**.
     - Always design your architecture to span **at least two Availability Zones** to ensure high availability. A solution in a single AZ is not truly highly available.

   - **Use load balancers with auto scaling**.
     - Load balancers work hand-in-hand with auto scaling groups to distribute traffic to instances and replace unhealthy instances. This is not default behavior, so ensure to enable health checks and configure auto scaling to terminate unhealthy instances.

### 3. **Database Scaling Tips**
   - **RDS Scaling Options**:
     - **Vertical Scaling**: Increase the instance size (e.g., from t2.micro to a larger instance).
     - **Storage Scaling**: Add more storage if you are running out.
     - **Horizontal Scaling**: Use **read replicas** for read-heavy workloads. Redirect read traffic to read replicas to distribute the load across multiple instances.

   - **DynamoDB Scaling**:
     - Use **auto scaling** for workloads with a **predictable access pattern** where read and write traffic gradually increases and decreases.
     - For **unpredictable workloads** with spiking traffic, choose **on-demand** capacity mode, which automatically adjusts to the workload.

## Summary
In the exam, always look for solutions that promote **high availability** and consider **horizontal scaling** as the primary choice. Use **vertical scaling** in specific cases like resizing instances for specific tasks. Be mindful of the cost, and ensure you select the most efficient and scalable solutions, such as using **read replicas** for RDS or switching to **DynamoDB** for scalable NoSQL solutions. Additionally, ensure that your solutions are spread across multiple **Availability Zones** for true high availability.

## Next Steps
When you're ready, proceed to the next lesson to further strengthen your understanding of AWS scaling and availability best practices. If you need more clarification or a deeper dive into any of the topics covered, feel free to revisit them and continue practicing.

Good luck with your exam preparation!


# Decoupling Workflows - Exam Tips

## Overview
Great job, Cloud Gurus! In this section, we’re reinforcing key concepts related to **decoupling workflows** in the cloud. In this guide, we’ll cover important tips and questions to ask yourself during the exam, along with crucial insights into various AWS services involved in decoupling and workflow orchestration.

## Exam Tips

### 1. **Key Questions to Ask Yourself**
   - **Are the workloads synchronous or asynchronous?**
     - Understanding whether the workload should be processed synchronously or asynchronously will help you determine the right services to use in your architecture.

   - **What type of decoupling makes sense?**
     - Do you need Pub/Sub (e.g., SNS) to broadcast messages to multiple consumers, or do you need something like a **Step Function** that can handle workflow orchestration?

   - **Does the order of messages matter?**
     - If order is critical, consider using **FIFO SQS queues** for guaranteed first-in-first-out processing. Otherwise, a **standard SQS queue** may be sufficient with backend deduplication.

   - **What type of application load are you expecting?**
     - Some services have limits on how many messages or requests they can handle. Make sure to select the service that fits the scale of your workload.

---

### 2. **AWS Services for Decoupling Workflows**

#### **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)**
   - **Message Duplication**: Standard SQS queues can sometimes duplicate messages. If you notice this happening, check for misconfigured visibility timeouts or failure to delete messages.
   - **Uni-directional**: SQS queues only allow one-way communication. If bi-directional communication is needed, use a second queue.
   - **Default Settings**: Be familiar with the default settings for SQS, such as the **visibility timeout** and message persistence (up to 14 days).
   - **FIFO vs. Standard**: If message order matters, select **FIFO queues**. Otherwise, use standard queues with deduplication logic on the backend.

#### **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
   - **Proactive Notifications**: If the question involves sending email, text, or other push notifications, think **SNS**.
   - **CloudWatch Integration**: If you're setting up notifications from **CloudWatch alarms**, choose **SNS** as the notification delivery service.

#### **API Gateway**
   - **Secure Front Door**: API Gateway acts as a secure entry point for external communication into your AWS environment. While not deeply complex, it is crucial to understand its basic role in securing external access.

#### **AWS Batch**
   - **Long-Running Workloads**: Use **AWS Batch** for workloads that take longer than **15 minutes**, as **AWS Lambda** has a 15-minute execution time limit.
   - **Batch Workload Queues**: If a workload requires queues, consider **AWS Batch**.
   - **Lambda Alternative**: If Lambda’s execution time is insufficient, **AWS Batch** can be a better alternative.

#### **Amazon MQ**
   - **Managed Broker Service**: **Amazon MQ** is a fully managed message broker service. If a scenario mentions **RabbitMQ** or **ActiveMQ**, think **Amazon MQ**.
   - **Protocols**: If the message protocol is **JMS** or similar, select **Amazon MQ** because SNS and SQS do not support these specific protocols.

#### **AWS Step Functions**
   - **Orchestration for Complex Workflows**: Use **Step Functions** when there are **conditional checks**, **failure catches**, or **wait periods** in the workflow.
   - **Wait Periods**: If the question involves workflows with a wait period lasting up to a year, **Step Functions** is likely the solution.

#### **Amazon AppFlow**
   - **SaaS Data Ingestion**: **Amazon AppFlow** is designed for bi-directional data flow between third-party SaaS applications and AWS services. It is ideal for simplified data ingestion.
   - **Common Scenario**: Look for scenarios where data from a third-party SaaS needs to be regularly stored in **Amazon S3**. This is a typical use case for **AppFlow**.

---

## Summary
In this section, we’ve covered key services used for decoupling workflows in AWS. The main takeaway is to understand the specific service needs based on whether your workloads are **synchronous** or **asynchronous**, whether **message order** matters, and the scale of the workload. You’ll also need to be comfortable selecting the appropriate service for orchestration (AWS Step Functions) or message passing (SNS, SQS, AppFlow).

## Introduction

This guide provides useful tips for understanding AWS caching services and their implementation, as well as how to efficiently approach exam scenarios. Understanding when and how to implement caching can significantly enhance the performance and cost-efficiency of your architecture.

## Caching in AWS

### When to Use Caching
Caching is an essential technique for improving the speed and performance of your application. It's useful when you want to:
- Speed up access to frequently requested data.
- Reduce the load on backend systems.
- Minimize the cost of retrieving data repeatedly from slower sources (e.g., databases).

### Caching Services Overview

#### CloudFront
- **CloudFront** is AWS's CDN (Content Delivery Network) that caches content at edge locations.
- **Use Case**: Distributing static content (e.g., websites, media files) with low latency to users worldwide.
- **Key Tip**: CloudFront enables HTTPS for secure connections, even when the content is hosted in an S3 bucket.

#### Global Accelerator
- **Global Accelerator** improves performance by directing users to the optimal AWS region.
- **Use Case**: For scenarios requiring fast, reliable access across global locations, especially where IP address caching is beneficial.
- **Key Tip**: Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that remain constant, even during failovers, which makes it suitable for IP caching.

#### Redis & Memcached
- **ElastiCache** offers in-memory data stores with **Redis** and **Memcached** as popular choices for caching.
- **Redis**: More feature-rich, supports backups, and can be used for persistent data storage.
- **Memcached**: Primarily used for caching and does not support backups.
- **Use Case**: Redis and Memcached are ideal for caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

## Exam Tips

### Can It Be Cached?
- Always think if caching can be applied to a scenario. For instance, consider using **Redis**, **Memcached**, or **DAX** for database caching, and **CloudFront** for content distribution.

### Choosing the Right Cache
- For **database solutions**, use **Redis** or **DAX** as in-memory databases.
- For **web content** and **static files**, prefer **CloudFront** for distribution.
- Remember, caches like **Memcached** and **DAX** are not permanent storage solutions and cannot serve as the source of truth for your data.

### Cache Updates and TTL
- **TTL (Time to Live)** determines how long the cache is valid before it expires and fetches fresh data. 
- Ensure you set appropriate TTLs to balance between data freshness and cache performance.

## Introduction

This guide provides useful insights and tips for approaching AWS governance-related exam questions. It includes strategies for managing resources, standardizing infrastructure, enforcing policies, and ensuring compliance. With these tips, you will be better prepared for governance scenarios in your AWS certification exams.

## Key Questions for Governance

Ask yourself these four questions when faced with governance-related exam questions:
1. **Can it be centralized?** - Can AWS RAM, Control Tower, or other services help centralize resources and accounts?
2. **How do we standardize it?** - How can we use AWS tools like Control Tower and guardrails to standardize deployments and account governance?
3. **How do we enforce standards?** - Leverage SCPs, AWS Config rules, guardrails, and CloudTrail for enforcing compliance and auditing.
4. **Are the users internal or external?** - Understand how to grant the right access to resources, using IAM, SSO, Cognito, and cross-account roles.

## AWS Organizations

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- SCPs control what actions are allowed or denied for AWS accounts, including the root account.
- Use SCPs to centralize logs and restrict unwanted API calls.

### Centralizing Logs
- Centralizing logs in a single account using CloudTrail is often the best solution.

## AWS Config

### Standardization and Compliance
- Use **AWS Config** to monitor compliance with your internal rules.

### Tracking Changes
- AWS Config provides a detailed history of resource and configuration changes, helping with troubleshooting and audits.

## Authentication and User Management

### AWS SSO and Cognito
- **AWS SSO** (now called **AWS Identity Center**) is recommended for managing internal users.
- For external users, **AWS Cognito** is the preferred service.

### Directory Service
- **AWS Managed Microsoft AD** is for lift-and-shift scenarios, while **AD Connector** is for connecting on-premises AD to AWS.

### Cross-Account Roles
- Use **cross-account roles** instead of IAM users to grant access to resources across different accounts.

## Cost Management

### Tracking and Budgeting
- Use **Cost Explorer** and **AWS Budgets** to monitor spending.
- Set up **SNS alerts** for proactive budget notifications (e.g., when 80% of a budget is reached).

### Cost Optimization
- **AWS Compute Optimizer** gives recommendations on optimizing compute resources, helping to save costs by sizing instances accurately.

### Cost Explorer and Reports
- **AWS Cost and Usage Reports** and **Cost Explorer** provide detailed insights into costs, which are essential for managing cloud spending.

## Trusted Advisor

- **Trusted Advisor** is an auditing tool that provides insights into your AWS setup but does not perform fixes automatically. It's available for free but requires a Business or Enterprise Support plan for more comprehensive checks.

## AWS Control Tower and Governance

- **AWS Control Tower** helps to implement governance and compliance policies across multiple accounts with automated account setups.
- Leverage **preventive guardrails** (via SCPs) and **detective guardrails** (via AWS Config) to enforce compliance.

## Infrastructure and Deployments

### Service Catalog
- **AWS Service Catalog** allows you to create, manage, and provision catalogs of approved services.

### AWS Proton
- **AWS Proton** automates the provisioning of full application stacks, including infrastructure and deployment pipelines for container-based or serverless applications.

### Well-Architected Tool
- The **Well-Architected Tool** helps you review architectural decisions and ensure alignment with AWS best practices.

## AWS Health

- **AWS Health** provides notifications of both public and account-specific AWS events, such as EC2 maintenance, which can be integrated with AWS Lambda for automation.

## Conclusion

By understanding these concepts and preparing accordingly, you'll be ready to tackle governance-related exam scenarios and make informed decisions when managing AWS environments. Emphasize automation, standardization, and compliance for effective governance and cost management.

Good luck with your studies, and stay tuned for more tips in upcoming lessons!

Here are four key questions you should ask yourself when preparing for migration exam scenarios:
1. **Where are we going?**
   - Understand if the migration is from on-premises to AWS, AWS to on-premises, or between cloud vendors/SaaS platforms.
2. **How do we get there?**
   - Choose between methods like AWS Snowball for bulk data transfers or AWS DMS for database migration.
3. **Is it all at once?**
   - Determine if the migration will occur in a single move (e.g., using Snowball) or in small increments via services like replication for AWS servers.
4. **Is it a partial migration?**
   - If the migration isn't all at once, consider services like S3 multi-part upload, server replication, or a lift-and-shift approach.

## AWS Snow Family

### Snowball
- **Use Case**: Best for transferring large amounts of data, especially when bandwidth is limited.
